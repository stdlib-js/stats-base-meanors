    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="installation">

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/stats-base-meanors
```

Alternatively,

-   To load the package in a website via a `script` tag without installation and bundlers, use the [ES Module][es-module] available on the [`esm`][esm-url] branch (see [README][esm-readme]).
-   If you are using Deno, visit the [`deno`][deno-url] branch (see [README][deno-readme] for usage intructions).
-   For use in Observable, or in browser/node environments, use the [Universal Module Definition (UMD)][umd] build available on the [`umd`][umd-url] branch (see [README][umd-readme]).

The [branches.md][branches-url] file summarizes the available branches and displays a diagram illustrating their relationships.

To view installation and usage instructions specific to each branch build, be sure to explicitly navigate to the respective README files on each branch, as linked to above.

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var meanors = require( '@stdlib/stats-base-meanors' );
```

#### meanors( N, x, strideX )

Computes the [arithmetic mean][arithmetic-mean] of a strided array using ordinary recursive summation.

```javascript
var x = [ 1.0, -2.0, 2.0 ];

var v = meanors( x.length, x, 1 );
// returns ~0.3333
```

The function has the following parameters:

-   **N**: number of indexed elements.
-   **x**: input [`Array`][mdn-array] or [`typed array`][mdn-typed-array].
-   **strideX**: stride length for `x`.

The `N` and stride parameters determine which elements in the strided array are accessed at runtime. For example, to compute the [arithmetic mean][arithmetic-mean] of every other element in `x`,

```javascript
var x = [ 1.0, 2.0, 2.0, -7.0, -2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.0 ];

var v = meanors( 4, x, 2 );
// returns 1.25
```

Note that indexing is relative to the first index. To introduce an offset, use [`typed array`][mdn-typed-array] views.

<!-- eslint-disable stdlib/capitalized-comments -->

```javascript
var Float64Array = require( '@stdlib/array-float64' );

var x0 = new Float64Array( [ 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, -2.0, -2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ] );
var x1 = new Float64Array( x0.buffer, x0.BYTES_PER_ELEMENT*1 ); // start at 2nd element

var v = meanors( 4, x1, 2 );
// returns 1.25
```

#### meanors.ndarray( N, x, strideX, offsetX )

Computes the [arithmetic mean][arithmetic-mean] of a strided array using ordinary recursive summation and alternative indexing semantics.

```javascript
var x = [ 1.0, -2.0, 2.0 ];

var v = meanors.ndarray( x.length, x, 1, 0 );
// returns ~0.33333
```

The function has the following additional parameters:

-   **offsetX**: starting index for `x`.

While [`typed array`][mdn-typed-array] views mandate a view offset based on the underlying buffer, the offset parameter supports indexing semantics based on a starting index. For example, to calculate the [arithmetic mean][arithmetic-mean] for every other element in `x` starting from the second element

```javascript
var x = [ 2.0, 1.0, 2.0, -2.0, -2.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 ];

var v = meanors.ndarray( 4, x, 2, 1 );
// returns 1.25
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   If `N <= 0`, both functions return `NaN`.
-   Ordinary recursive summation (i.e., a "simple" sum) is performant, but can incur significant numerical error. If performance is paramount and error tolerated, using ordinary recursive summation to compute an arithmetic mean is acceptable; in all other cases, exercise due caution.
-   Both functions support array-like objects having getter and setter accessors for array element access (e.g., [`@stdlib/array-base/accessor`][@stdlib/array/base/accessor]).
-   Depending on the environment, the typed versions ([`dmeanors`][@stdlib/stats/strided/dmeanors], [`smeanors`][@stdlib/stats/base/smeanors], etc.) are likely to be significantly more performant.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var discreteUniform = require( '@stdlib/random-array-discrete-uniform' );
var meanors = require( '@stdlib/stats-base-meanors' );

var x = discreteUniform( 10, -50, 50, {
    'dtype': 'float64'
});
console.log( x );

var v = meanors( x.length, x, 1 );
console.log( v );
